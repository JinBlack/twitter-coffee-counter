======================

Twitter Coffee Counter is a Twitter bot that helps friendly workplaces in coffee accounting. It supports two simple operations: (1) &quot;top up&quot;, to add coffee to someone&#39;s account, and (2) &quot;drink up&quot;, to remove coffee from someone&#39;s account. To use it, simply create a private Twitter account, and ask your co-workers to send tweets to it. For example, to &quot;top up&quot; one coffee just &quot;@private_account +1&quot;; to consume two coffees just &quot;@private_account -2&quot;. Twitter Coffee Counter also features a dashboard web app to monitor the amount of coffee consumed by each co-worker.
